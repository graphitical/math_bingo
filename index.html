  <h1>Maths BINGO - $\beta$ version</h1>
  <p>
    Maths BINGO is a simple way to place LaTeX based math equations into a standard 5x5 BINGO card.<br>
    <h4>Use</h4>
    To use, simply:
    <ol>
      <li>Type your equation into the text field using LaTeX markup. If you don't know how <a href=https://editor.codecogs.com/>this</a> may help.</a></li>
      <li>Click the *Add Equation* button, or hit the *Enter* key once done.</li>
      <li>Repeat until you have entered all the equations you wish.</li>
    </ol>
    You can preview all the equations you've entered on the left. If you find you've made a mistake you can hit the red delete button next to the equation.<br>
    Or you can hit the *Clear Equations* button, but be careful with that one. It cannot be undone. 

    <h4>Generating A Card</h4>
    The card will first have just $x$ to fill all the spots. They will always fill up the remainder of the table.<br>
    Once you have created 24 equations you should no longer see any $x$ (unless you put a $x$ in yourself).<br>
    As you add equations they will automatically fill the card in a random order so you will see them move around a bit.<br>
    You can also click the *Shuffle* button to rearrange the equations you see.<br>
    Ideally, you will have many more than 24 equations, so you may not see all of them on the card. That's ok, they aren't lost, just waiting for a new card.<br>
    Go ahead and click *Shuffle* or *Save* to scramble them up again.

    <h4>Saving A Card *Experimental*</h4>
    You can save a card as a PNG file to print on your own. Just click the *Save* button.<br>
    A new tab should be generated with your image to save.<br>
    There has been minimal testing with this so it is the most likely part to break right now.<br>
    If you need a higher resolution (i.e. larger) image try zooming in your browser (Ctrl +) and saving again.<br>
    Finally, if there are any issues when you try to save, just try hitting that *Save* button again. It may just work...
